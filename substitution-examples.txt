# Sample substitution rules to use with typestrings
# 
# Lines beginning with # are ignored, empty lines are ignored
#
# Define substitutions on the left of the colon, which 
# will be replaced with the glpyhs right of the colon:
# 
#  - The left side is a unicode string to be matched in the text
#  - The right side is a glyphname to be found in the UFO file
#  - One rule per line
#  - If a left side string is not found, the rule is ignored
#  - If a right side glyphname is not found in the ufo, the rule
#    is ignored (use --verbose to output any not found glyphs)
